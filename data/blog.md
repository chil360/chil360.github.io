- Kernel changes: backported binder updates, add core_ctl, some additional cpufreq commits
- Power config: configure cpusets, interactive govenor tweaks (core_ctl is disabled as was found to be too aggressive)
- Audio: Use deepbuffer instead of lowlatency - this, hopefully, now fixes the audio crackling issue.
