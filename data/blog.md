GZOSP Beta.2.0 monthly build with May security update

**Device changes since last month's build:**
- Kernel built with updated GCC 8.3-2019.03 toolchain
- Kernel changes: backported binder updates, add core_ctl, some additional cpufreq commits
- Power config: configure cpusets, interactive govenor tweaks (core_ctl is disabled as was found to be too aggressive)
- Audio: Use deepbuffer instead of lowlatency - this, hopefully, now fixes the audio crackling issue.
- Audio: Uprev Audio HALs to 4.0
- Kill pinner service: Don't hold core system components in memory as it consumes too much RAM (especially for 1Gb devices) with little performance benefit.
